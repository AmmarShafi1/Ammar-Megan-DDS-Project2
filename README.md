# Wine Quality Prediction and Insights for Robert Renzoni Vineyards

## Introduction

This project for **Robert Renzoni Vineyards** in Riverside, California, aims to predict wine quality and identify key factors for improvement. The focus is on:

### Objectives
1. **Objective A:** Build a machine learning model to predict wine quality (scores 0â€“10) with minimal **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
2. **Objective B:** Analyze data to uncover factors influencing high-quality wine and provide actionable insights for better production.

---

## Objective A: Predictive Modeling

Develop a regression model to minimize MAE, a metric that measures average prediction errors. Lower MAE ensures higher model accuracy, providing a reliable quality assessment tool.

- **Evaluation:** Effective use of feature engineering and handling missing data (**Missing at Random**) will score higher.

---

## Objective B: Data Insights for Vintners

Analyze the relationships between wine properties and quality to guide **Head Vintner Olivia Bue** in improving production.
